  <h1>From Stroke to Vision</h1>
  <p>
    A personal story of survival, care, and an idea born from suffering.
    <br>
    This website is not only about what happened to me,
    but about what millions of people live every day.

  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
    On July 28th, 2024, I returned home with a severe headache.
    Shortly after, I lost consciousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was alone. My partner was working in another city, nearly ten hours away.
    When my messages stopped, he got in the car and drove all night.
    Without the keys to the house, he had to call the fire department.
  </p>
  <p>
    They found me unconscious.
    I had suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many parts of what happened are still missing from my memory.
    The area of the brain responsible for thought and recall was damaged,
    and some memories simply disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
    I underwent a nine-and-a-half-hour brain surgery
    to remove the blood clot compressing my brain
    and to reopen the blocked vessels.
  </p>

  <h2>Inside the Hospital</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
    When I slowly regained awareness, the right side of my body was completely paralyzed.
    I could not speak. I could not move my legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remember the sounds of machines, the nurses, the endless CT scans,
    and the shared suffering of the people around me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even while bedridden, my mind kept asking one question:
    <strong>How can I make this easier for them?</strong>
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Recovery</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
    In mid-September 2024, I returned home.
    I began speech therapy and studied again from the basics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Slowly, my vision returned.
    But one idea never left me.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Project – Patent Pending</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
    From hospital life and from caring for my elderly mother,
    I saw a reality that is accepted as normal but should not be.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project was born from lived suffering.
    It is currently under patent application,
    therefore technical details cannot be shared yet.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Daily Reality</h2>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>
    These images represent everyday life for patients, nurses, and families.
    They are not the project itself, but the reason it exists.

    This project was not born in a laboratory.<br>
    It was born in a hospital bed.
